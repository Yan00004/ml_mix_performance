# Machine Learning Models for Asphalt Mixture Performance Prediction

Tianhao Yan, yantianhao2022@gmail.com, 7/24/2025

This project aims to develop machine learning model for performance prediction of asphalt mixtures based on a dataset shared by NCAT. 

The project contains 4 consecutive tasks:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation, [Python Notebook](https://github.com/Yan00004/ml_mix_performance/blob/main/mix_performance_prediction_Q1.ipynb)
2. Data Comparison Across Years, [Python Notebook](https://github.com/Yan00004/ml_mix_performance/blob/main/mix_performance_prediction_Q2.ipynb)
3. Development of Models, [Python Notebook](https://github.com/Yan00004/ml_mix_performance/blob/main/mix_performance_prediction_Q3.ipynb)
4. Deployment of Developed Models, [Web App](www.tianhao-yan/app_bmd/)
